**Conversational Agent Workflow for Python Development**

This project introduces a conversational agent framework designed to facilitate Python software development processes, integrating intelligent agents specialized in programming, testing, debugging, and execution tasks. Leveraging Langchain's capabilities and the Codellama chat interface powered by Ollama, developers can engage in dynamic interactions with agents to enhance productivity and code quality throughout the development lifecycle.

**Key Features:**

1. **Role-based Agents:** The system features four distinct agents tailored to specific roles in Python development: Programmer, Tester, Debugger, and Executor. Each agent provides specialized guidance, feedback, and assistance relevant to its role, enabling developers to effectively perform their tasks.

2. **Intelligent Prompting:** Agents interact with developers through intelligent prompts, offering step-by-step instructions, task explanations, and guidelines to streamline the development process. From algorithm selection to error handling, developers receive contextual support tailored to their current objectives.

3. **Flexible Workflow Management:** The workflow orchestrates the sequence of interactions between agents and developers, ensuring seamless transitions between tasks and roles. Conditional edges dynamically adapt the workflow based on user input, errors encountered, or specific conditions, optimizing the development flow.

4. **Integration with Ollama:** The integration with Ollama, a sophisticated language model, empowers agents to generate contextually relevant responses, code suggestions, and error handling strategies. Developers can engage in natural language conversations with agents, receiving insightful feedback and actionable insights.

**Workflow Overview:**

- **Programming Phase:** Developers collaborate with the Programmer agent to write efficient, readable Python code. From problem understanding to code generation, the agent guides developers through each step of the development process.

- **Testing Phase:** The Tester agent assists developers in creating comprehensive test cases to validate code functionality and robustness. Basic and edge test cases cover various scenarios, ensuring thorough code testing and quality assurance.

- **Debugging Phase:** The Debugger agent analyzes code snippets and error messages to identify and address potential issues. By generating error-free code and error-handling strategies, developers can troubleshoot and debug their Python programs effectively.

- **Execution Phase:** The Executor agent adds a testing layer to Python code, executing it and validating the output against expected results. Developers receive feedback on code execution and testing outcomes, enabling them to refine and optimize their implementations.

**Usage Instructions:**

- **Launching the Chat Interface:** Developers can initiate the Codellama chat interface and interact with agents by typing questions or commands. The interface provides a user-friendly environment for engaging with agents and receiving guidance on Python development tasks.

- **User Input and Interaction:** Developers can input Python code snippets, requirements, questions, or commands to interact with agents. Agents respond with relevant feedback, suggestions, or instructions, guiding developers through various stages of software development.

- **Feedback and Iteration:** Developers can provide feedback on agent responses, indicating whether the provided guidance or code suggestions meet their expectations. Agents adapt their responses based on user feedback, fostering iterative improvements and effective collaboration.
